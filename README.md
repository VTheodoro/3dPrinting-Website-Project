# Project: Website on 3D Printing - Creality K1

This repository contains the files of one of the first websites developed by me as part of a project during the first year of the Systems Development course at ETEC, in the Web Programming discipline, under the supervision of Professor [@Fbamuniz](https://github.com/fbamuniz).

## Project Description

The project consists of a website that explains how 3D printing works and highlights the possibilities of this technology, using the Creality K1 printer as an example. It was developed in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, being one of the first websites created by the contributors. The work was carried out in a group, with significant contributions from all members. Programming was mainly led by Victor, while design, texts, and ideas were developed by Miguel and Larissa using Figma.
